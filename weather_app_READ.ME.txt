virtualbox with 2 network adapters, 2 local, 1 internet
create user account that has sudo rights
base line OS is based on vanilla centos7 minimal

PREREQUISITES:
update system: sudo yum update
install wget: sudo yum install wget
check version of python: python -v [should be 2.7.x]
install epel repository
-wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-8.noarch.rpm
-rpm -ivh epel-release-7-8.noarch.rpm
install pip for python: sudo yum install python-pip
update pip: sudo pip install --upgrade pip
install 'requests' library: sudo pip install requests


unzip and untar the code package in your local directory
tar -zxvf weather.tar.gz -C ./weather_app

to run the app:
cd ./code/weather
./wu_prog.py -s <monitoring schedule in seconds> 

output and alerts are written into: userAlert.log
debug log goes to: wu_prog.log

to edit the weather locations and temps you want to monitor
edit locations.txt
you can have any number of locations. format is:
<country or state>/<city>, <low temp>, <high temp>
for example:
CA/San Fransisco, 0, 20

If weather prediction on any of the 5 days is predicted to be less than low temp and/or
higher than high temp limits for the location an alert is generated to userAlerts.log

NOTES:
Weather underground free tier allows 10 weather requests per minute to the server. 
Key file (wunderground.key) allows you to connect to Weather Underground service
The program wont allow shorter than 60 second weather report polling interval.
-This is to try to avoid receiving 'denial of service' response from Weather Underground

IMPROVEMENTS:
a lot of checks for user errors and response codes from the wunderground service are missing
code is partially testable using unit tests

you could also easily split this into multiple python scripts and use cron jobs to run
the app instead of building it into a single python 'application'

adding twitter direct messaging (using Tweepy) could add value instead of writing alerts
to file. This area could easily be improved and more general app be developed
